# Global Currency Mass Value Standard

Let us use e to denote the monetary currency exchange rate from USD$ to NTD$. So we may state the following:
  ```
  (Eq. 1)    USD$ = e NTD$
  ```
Let q be the Greatest Denomination Coin Mass GDCM) of USD$, which is the mass of the quarter coin, and t be the GDCM of NTD$, which is the mass of the 50 dollar coin. Then let us introduce the Currency Mass Value (CMV) for USD* and NTD* based on the GDCM standard, both having units USD$/g. So we have the two relations:
  ```
  (Eq. 2)    USD* = 0.25 USD$ / q
  (Eq. 3)    NTD* = 50 NTD$ * (USD$ / e NTD$) / t = 50 / (e * t)
  ```
If we substitute the values for each of the following:
  ```
  (Eq. 4)    e = 28.98 (Sep 21, 9:29 PM UTC)
  (Eq. 5)    q = 5.670 g
  (Eq. 6)    t = 10 g
  ```
Then we can calculate the CMV for both currencies:
  ```
  (Eq. 7)    USD* = 0.04409 USD$/g
  (Eq. 8)    NTD* = 0.1725 USD$/g
  ```
Now, if we look the two conversion rates side by side, we see a discrepancy. This demonstrates the current economy between US and Taiwan based on the classical monitory exchange system is not mass conservative using the GDCM standard. Since most of the world economy still use the US$ as the reference currency for calculating inflation and exchange rates, it is most convenient to state:
  ```
  (Def. 1)    the Global Currency Mass Value Standard (GCMVS) is equal to 0.04409 USD$/g.
  ```
Furthermore, we can impose conservation of mass for the currency exchange between NTD$ and USD$ by stating:
  ```
  (Eq.9)    USD* = NTD*
  ```
we can now introduce the currency mass value exchange rate e* and calculate  it by setting the NTC* given by expression in Eq. 3 to GCMVS:
  ```
  (Eq. 10)    GCMVS = 0.04409 USD$/g = NTD* = 50 NTD$ * (USD$ / e NTD$) / t = 50 / (e * t)
  ```
So we have,
  ```
  e* = 113.4
  ```
So in order for mass to be conserved,the actual monetary exchange rate should be NTD $113.4 for each USD$. We can introduce a monetary-mass exchange factor k defined by the following:
  ```
  (Def. 2)    k = e* / e
  ```
So we can calculate k:
  ```
  (Eq. 11)    k = 113.4 / 28.98 = 3.913
  ```
What this means is that for a USD$ currency holder, each dollar they spend purchasing NTD$ on the classical monetary exchange market buys only  about 1/4 of the actual mass value of the NTC$. So we may state that "The NTC$ has a CMV exchange surplus of 3.913 with USD$". Conversly, we can also say that "the USD$ has a CMV exchange deficit of 0.2556 with NTC$". The goal of the world economy should be to excavate natural resource, produce goods, and relocate people affecting k towards 1 for all currencies to achieve global currency mass conservation.
